# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The objective of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program as a way to address a potential massive retirements wave at Pewlett-Hackard known internally as the ‘silver tsunami”

## Results
Based on the latest data, we see that over 90K employees might be retiring soon across departments.
Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are by far the most common titles, accounting for over half the total needs of future replacements, as seen in fig.1

The propose mentorship program has identified a set of users that could come into help solve the issue, however the number among those born in 1965, the ones identified to potentially fill the gap seems to be too small to impact in a meaningful way the gap that will be left by the potential retirees. See Fig.2

** Aditional ideas of how to help the shortage **
-	Increase the selection range of ages from born in 1965 to a larger range, like 1965 to 1970
-	Implement an apprenticeship program that gathers new/younger employees to fill the base as current employees with more seniority/experience move to fill the positions to be left by upcoming retirees
-	Review in more detail the by department needs, since having the same title alone won’t guarantee there is enough personal to cover (or not) the potential openings.


## Summary 

The amount of potential openings to be left by the upcoming retirees is way larger than the amount of employees that could potentially fill them in and therefore more work is required to formulate a plan to fill in the gap from inside talent alone. Keeping some of the retirees as part timers to mentor younger/junior colleagues alone won’t be enough; hiring to fill in then the positions left by the mentees are also needed.
